Recent research has led to the introduction of numerous benchmarks aimed at systematically evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse domains and tasks. These benchmarks enable the community to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs. 

Key benchmarking innovations include:

- [L-Eval: Instituting Standardized Evaluation for Long Context Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11088v3) - Proposes benchmark suite and metrics to evaluate LLM performance on long input contexts.

- [TRAM: Benchmarking Temporal Reasoning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00835v2) - Introduces benchmark composed of datasets covering various aspects of temporal reasoning. 

- [MathVista: Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning of Foundation Models in Visual Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02255v1) - Constructs benchmark amalgamating math and visual QA datasets requiring compositional reasoning.

- [ARN: A Comprehensive Framework and Dataset for Analogical Reasoning on Narratives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01074v1) - Develops benchmark and framework for evaluating analogical reasoning in narratives using LLMs.

- [LLM-grounded Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17444v2) - Benchmarks video generation from text descriptions using LLMs to guide video diffusion models. 

- [FELM: Benchmarking Factuality Evaluation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00741v1) - Introduces benchmark annotating LLM responses for evaluating factuality models.

- [L2CEval: Evaluating Language-to-Code Generation Capabilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17446v2) - Presents systematic evaluation of LLMs on 7 language-to-code generation tasks.

The introduction of these rigorous benchmarks has been pivotal in furthering LLM research and enabling the community to track progress. However, there remains ample room for constructing additional benchmarks evaluating LLMs across even more diverse settings and applications.
